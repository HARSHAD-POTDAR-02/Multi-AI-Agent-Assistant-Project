# 🚀 Enhanced Prioritization Agent - Demo Guide

## What's New vs Old System

### **Old System:**
- Basic priority sorting by due date + priority level
- Generic responses
- No learning or context awareness
- Simple keyword matching

### **New Enhanced System:**
- **Smart Context Awareness** - Knows your energy, time, momentum
- **Behavioral Learning** - Learns your patterns over time
- **Natural Conversations** - Responds like a productivity coach
- **Proactive Insights** - Warns about overdue tasks, suggests optimal timing
- **Multi-factor Scoring** - Energy-task matching, momentum, urgency

## Test Queries to Try

### **Basic Prioritization**
```
"What should I work on next?"
"Prioritize my tasks"
"I'm feeling overwhelmed, help me focus"
"Which task is most important right now?"
```

### **Context-Aware Queries**
```
"I have 30 minutes before my meeting, what can I do?"
"I'm tired, what's a good task for low energy?"
"I'm in the zone, what should I tackle?"
"I just finished 3 tasks, what's next?"
```

### **Natural Conversation**
```
"I'm stressed about my deadlines"
"Too many things on my plate"
"I keep procrastinating on this project"
"I'm having a productive day, keep me going!"
```

### **Smart Task Creation**
```
"Create task: Finish quarterly report by Friday"
"Add task: Call client about project update, 30 minutes"
"New task: Research competitor analysis, due next week"
```

### **Analytics & Insights**
```
"How am I doing with my tasks?"
"Show me my productivity insights"
"What's my completion rate?"
"Any overdue tasks I should worry about?"
```

## Expected Enhanced Responses

### **Instead of:** "Task #1 has priority score 8/10"
### **You'll get:** "I'd recommend starting with 'Finish quarterly report' - it's due tomorrow and matches your current high energy level. You've got this! 💪"

### **Instead of:** "3 tasks found"
### **You'll get:** "You have 3 active tasks. Your energy is good and you have time - great moment to make progress! I'd suggest tackling the report first since it's urgent and you're in a productive flow."
