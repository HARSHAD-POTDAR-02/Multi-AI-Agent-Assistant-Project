# Gmail API Setup Guide

To enable email drafting functionality, you need to set up Gmail API credentials:

## Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API for your project

## Step 2: Create Credentials
1. Go to "Credentials" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth client ID"
3. Choose "Desktop application"
4. Download the JSON file and rename it to `credentials.json`
5. Place `credentials.json` in the project root directory

## Step 3: Set up GROQ API Key
1. Get your GROQ API key from [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Update the `.env` file with your actual API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
   ```

## Step 4: First Run
- When you first use the email drafting feature, it will open a browser for Gmail authorization
- Grant the necessary permissions
- A `token.json` file will be created automatically
